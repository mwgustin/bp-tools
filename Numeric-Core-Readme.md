Numeric Core calculator from the game Blue Prince


Written in C# / DotNet 10 (preview).

Run with `dotnet run 1234` or `dotnet run` and get prompted for a number.

Accepts either a single 4+ character number, or 4 separate numbers separated by a space (`dotnet run 1 2 3 4`)

If run as a single input, the parser will run through all possible permutation and find the lowest core.
